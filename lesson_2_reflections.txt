What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When I initialize a repository metadat folder for the files in the repository gets created. Initializing the repository helps me start version controlling my project/repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is an intermediate area between working directory and repository. It is good because it helps me put only those files in a commit that were logically bound.
